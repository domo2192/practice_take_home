### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. Endpoints can be added. If you plan to use this engine with the frontend web application, if the endpoints are changed subsequent updates will be necessary on the Frontend repository code.
